Hello! This is Jakub Kowal’s project for IS218! I chose to implement option 9 (User Profile Management). This allows higher ups to upgrade accounts into higher tier accounts that have less restricted access to certain options. A normal user can only update their own accounts while higher ups have access to more fields for editing. The app then sends an email that informs the user that their accounts has been updated. Throughout the course I have learned many valuable lessons with the biggest one being not to give up. There were plenty of times that the assignment called to implement something that I have never done before and it was the most frustrating thing ever! Only for next week having the challenge of implementing two things at once. I learned how important documentation was, not only putting it on my own code but others as well. Any time a new API was introduced I would spend a long time looking through the documentation provided to soak up as much as possible to ensure that later on I wouldn’t waste too much time for something that should have been trivial. Although plenty of time was wasted anyways. I learned how to properly read an error code and then walk through the logic to see what was causing issues and how to make it run smoothly. The most important thing I learned was testing. Making code that can be analyzed by itself and ensures that it is good is magic to me still. It allows me to provide proof to anyone who cares that this will work. I have also learned about the coding principles that guide software development everywhere. Abbreviations like CRUD (create, read, update, delete) will also pop up throughout my professional career. DevOps as a whole was unknown to me and know that is a direction that I am looking forward to undertaking as a career. More than any class I took before it this class challenged me to take on things I would have never thought possible. Before, I would be scarred to look at API documentation. After being forced to do so and even make my own I realize now that the best way to learn is to do. I am aware that it may sound foolish now, but it really made me look at the way I do everything a little differently than before. Being more informed and cautious saves a lot of time down the road rather than just running into a wall over and over again. Have a great holiday break.
